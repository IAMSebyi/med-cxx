# MED-CXX

MED-CXX is a C++ project built with an object-oriented design, aiming to solve key medical imaging problems through deep learning. The project focuses on implementing and training several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures — including U-Net, ResNet, and DenseNet — entirely in C++ using LibTorch (the PyTorch C++ API).

These models are applied to core medical tasks such as blood vessel segmentation, disease detection from medical scans, and image-based classification of pathological conditions.

MED-CXX was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab course project at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest, with a focus on clarity, reusability, and clean class structure.
